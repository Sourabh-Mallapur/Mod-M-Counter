# Mod-m-Counter
This Repo contains the design flow for MOD-13, synchronous, binary ‘up’ counter (using TannerEDA software for simulation purposes).
Design and Simulation done using S-Edit - An analog mixed-signal design flow providing design capture, simulation set-up, launch and results analysis verification.

For this Project we will design Mod-13 Up Counter

Introduction
In a Typical Full-Custom IC Design Flow,
